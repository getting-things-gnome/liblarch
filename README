Liblarch, a python library to easily handle data structure


Liblarch is a python library built to easily handle data structure such are lists, trees and acyclic graphs (tree where nodes can have multiple parents). There's also a liblarch-gtk binding that will allow you to use your data structure into a Gtk.Treeview.

Liblarch support multiple views of one data structure and complex filtering. That way, you have a clear separation between your data themselves (Model) and how they are displayed (View).

If you find Gtk.Treeview and Gtk.Treemodel hard to use, then liblarch is probably for you. 

The documentation can be read on: https://live.gnome.org/liblarch
